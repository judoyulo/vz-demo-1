# AI Bot API Setup Guide

## 🚀 Enhanced AI Bot with OpenAI Integration

The AI Bot now supports **OpenAI GPT API** for much more intelligent and natural conversations!

### 📋 Features

- **Smart Conversations**: AI responses are now much more intelligent and contextual
- **Personality-Driven**: Each AI character (Alex, Maya, Jordan) has unique personality and interests
- **Fallback System**: If OpenAI API is unavailable, falls back to enhanced local responses
- **Voice & Text**: AI can respond with both text and voice messages
- **Context Awareness**: AI remembers conversation history for better responses

### 🔧 Setup Instructions

#### Option 1: Use OpenAI GPT API (Recommended)

1. **Get OpenAI API Key**:
   - Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create an account or sign in
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the API key

2. **Configure Environment**:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the project root
   - Add your API key:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Restart the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Option 2: Use Local AI Responses (No Setup Required)

- If no OpenAI API key is provided, the app automatically uses enhanced local responses
- Local responses are much smarter than before and personality-driven
- No external API calls required

### 🎭 AI Personalities

### 💡 How It Works

1. **Message Processing**: When you send a message to an AI Bot, the system analyzes your message
2. **Personality Matching**: The AI responds based on the character's personality and interests
3. **Context Awareness**: AI considers conversation history for better responses
4. **Response Generation**:
   - If OpenAI API is available: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for intelligent responses
   - If not available: Uses enhanced local response logic
5. **Voice/Text Decision**: AI decides whether to respond with text or voice (30% voice probability)

### 🔍 Testing the AI

1. **Start the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to Chat tab**: Click on "💬 Chats"
3. **Select an AI Bot**: Choose Alex, Maya, or Jordan
4. **Send messages**: Try different types of messages:
   - "Hi, how are you?"
   - "I love technology!"
   - "What's your favorite music?"
   - "Tell me about fitness"
   - "Could you rap?"
